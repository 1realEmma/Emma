            <b><u>MY BIOGRAPHY</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p><i>
            I am Emmanuella Afefa Bamezon. A first year biomedical engineering student of KNUST. My passion for engineering did not begin all of a sudden. I have always loved to solve complex problems pertaining to health care delivery.
            This vision and dream has always behoved a sense of responsibility towards the health and well being of the immediate people I come into contact with.
        My admission into this noble institution is not just a dream come true but a stepping stone towards the responsibilities ahead.

        <p><i>
            The engineering principles and abilities I have acquired so far has given me an assurance that indeed this dream of mine is not far from reality.
            With God and the resilience I have towards aspiring to be a biomedical engineer, I can bodly tell the my beloved motherland;Ghana and the world at large to await an exceptional delivery from me.
